                            This plot demonstrates the US population by states from 2009 to 2013.  Interestingly, throughout this time California and Texas are the two most populated state. The residence of California increased steadily by approximately 0.3 million on average while the population gain of Texas is about 0.1 million per year. On the other hand, Vermont is the least populated state, and its number of residents did not change at all throughout these four years. According to demographic Statisticians, the migration flow between states often causes the population to alter. To understand the root causation of population change, let us examine the population migration of the four US states throughout this period.

                            The filled chord plot to the right shows the population migration between states from 2009 to 2013. Here, colors symbolize four major US regions. In other words, green, yellow, purple, and red indicates Midwest, Northeast, South, and West respectively. The volume of the chord indicates the population migrated influx and outflux. To be more precise, thicker chords signify more people has relocated to or away from that particular region. According to the data, one unexpecting fact is that Texas had more population migration instead of California which indicates that it is not appropriate to assume relocation between state is the sole factor for population growth. Relocation from other areas such as foreign countries and newborn babies can also be contributing to population gain. Now that we have analyzed the state population, it is time for us to discover patterns between it, and other attributes such as GDP, household income, and industry revenue. Let us scrutinize the data in more detail!!

                        The bubble animation on the left exhibits the relationship between GDP and population per state from 2009 to 2013. Colors represent the four major US regions while the size of the bubble indicates the population size. In other words, the bubbles with a larger area respresent larger populations.  In general, GDP and population inherit a positive icorrelation as portrayed in the plot. In more detail, the two most populated states, California and Texas acquired the largest GDP value during this period. Conversely, the GDP value is lowest among all states across these four years. The data illustrates that a state with more population is likely to obtain a larger GDP.  To dig deeper, let us examine the relationship between household count and income in these two most prosperous states.

                            The histogram to the left displays the percentage of household income in ten distinct categories of income of California and Texas. The category has been segregated by a range of household income in ascending fashion. The black represents California while blue signifies Texas. At first glance, it might seems that the household percentage in each category for both states are not quite distinguishable. Nonetheless, examining the graph more carefully, there seems to be an existing trend. For the first 6 categories, it seems the household percentage of Texas is greater than those of California. However, in the latter four categories, California's household percentage seems to exceed the ones of Texas.  This indicates that households in California earned higher salaries than those in Texas. This perhaps is one of the contributors to which California had higher GDP for all four years. Next, to let us discover some interesting facts about industry revenue of California.

                            The histogram at right shows the breakdown of California's sale value for different industries from 2009 to 2013. By clicking, the visualization displays a break down of industry revenue of California of the selected year. In details, it is evident that Real Estate Rental and Leasing; Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services; and Other Services were the top 3 industries in California, which implying that California was the state of the third industry, the state of service. It was then not surprised to find that the industries with the lowest sales value in California consisted of Utilities, Transportation, and Mining. However, one interesting fact was that, though California was the dominant state in the United States, its sales value in Education was relatively low. It seemed that California people did not pay much for education in recent years.
