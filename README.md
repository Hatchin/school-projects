# Twitter Sentiment Project

In this project, I fetched Twitter data using Twitter API and tweepy, then performed sentiment analysis using vaderSentiment library. After that, I produced a web server running on AWS displaying given user's recent tweet list color-coded by sentiment. I also created a page displays the list of users followed by a given user.

The final product looks like this:
