# Article Recommender

## Description
In this project, I built a simple article recommender engine using natural language processing of word2vec. The word embedding vector data was from [Stanford's GloVe project](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/).

The project involves reading in a database of word vectors and a corpus of text articles then organizing them into a handy table (list of lists) for processing. I also built a web server that displays a list of articles. Clicking on one of those articles takes you to an article page that shows the text of the article as well as a list of five recommended articles:
