# Clustering and Unsupervised Learning - Eigenface Problem

This project is to identify the four “eigen-faces” of the image corpus and then identify similarities between those images.

In order to do so, the following process was performed:
* web scrapping 
* image alignment
* PCA analysis
* clustering
* network visualization
