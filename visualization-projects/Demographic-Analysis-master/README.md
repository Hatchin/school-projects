# Demographic Analysis
This goal of this project is to analyze population alteration and its relationship to other attributes such as population migration, GDP, household income and industry revenue of all states that make up the United States of America from 2009 to 2013. 

Please visit the [project web page](https://yuyun2.github.io/) for more information. 

## Code 
The root directory contains all code.
  
`Plot1_ChoroplethHeatMap_Plot3_BubbleAnimation_Plot5_HistogramIndustry`: This notebook includes three visualizations. First, the choropleth heat map which demonstrates the population alteration of all states.  Second, the bubble animation which displays the relationship of GDP and population for each state. Last, the histogram of the distribution of industry revenue of the most populated state, California.  


`Plot2_Data_Process_Chord_Diagram.ipynb`: Data process for the chord diagram.  


`Plot2_chord_diag.R`: The chord diagram shows the migration flow between states of the United States. 


`Plot4_Histogram.ipynb`: The histogram displays the distribution of household income of the two most populated states, California and Texas.  

Libraries:  
  
- Data procssing: pandas, numpy and time
- Visualization: plotly (Python) and chorddiag (R)
